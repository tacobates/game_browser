	After my kids' old PC died, I decided to let them use a spare Raspberry Pi I had.
	We played around with RetroPie, which was amazing, but it lacked the full features of a Linux desktop &amp; it didn't force them to learn anything about Linux.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>
	So I installed Raspbian with Pixel and let the kids loose on it.
	They loved it, and are learning a great deal about their new OS, but they get frustrated with many of the road blocks.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>
	At first I started created myriad shell scripts and putting them in folders where my kids could click on them to launch a DOS game with complicated comfiguration, or a shell game that required command line parameters.
	This worked well, but was tiresome.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>
	...and then my Pi bricked.
	I was able to format the SD card and reinstall, but all that custom work was gone.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>
	So I decided to create a project that would be simple to setup and pull all comfiguration from my Github account.
	This way if the kids ever destroyed their Pi, I could always set up another and configure it quickly.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>
	While my little pet project couldn't ever hope to rival the polish of RetroPie, I hope it gives some of the ease of game play while still allowing you to leverage a full Linux OS.
